# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning
My adventures in Data Science and Machine Learning

This repository contains all the notes for basic machine libraries needed for data science and machine learning like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to advenced machine learning algorithms like Linear/Logistic Regression, K-Means Clustering, and Support Vector Machines. It also includes the advanced topics such as Natural Language Processing, Big Data, Neural Net and Deep Learning. 

Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, sklearn, pyspark and tensorflow. (I might have missed some libraries.)

If you have anaconda installed, the above mentioned libraries are included, but if you are planning on using it without the anaconda distribution, you have to install the libraries. 

Open a new Command Prompt or a terminal window

Type the following command:

      pip install library_name

Thank You
