# Data-Science-and-Visualization
My adventures in Data Science
This repository contains all the notes for basic libraries needed for data science and machine learning like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and sklearn (I might have missed some libraries.)

If you have anaconda installed, the above mentioned libraries are included, but if you are planning on using it without the anaconda distribution, you have to install the libraries. 

Open a new Command Prompt or a terminal window

Type the following command:

      pip install library_name

Thank You
